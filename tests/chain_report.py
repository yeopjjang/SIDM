"""Per-PR chain report for SIDM.

Runs the SidmProcessor over a small committed fixture and reports the state of the
processing + plotting chain, so a reviewer can see -- side by side, current (main)
vs. this PR -- what executes, what errors, what warns, and how the cutflows move.
It does NOT gate the merge; it informs the reviewer.

Two modes:
    python tests/chain_report.py compute state.json              # run chain, dump state to file
    python tests/chain_report.py render base.json pr.json        # diff two states -> markdown

CI runs `compute` once on the base commit and once on the PR, then `render`s the
diff into the GitHub Actions job summary. `render` exits 1 (a soft-red check) only
when the PR introduces a NEW error; see new_errors() for the exact list.

NOTE: this reports EXECUTION + regression, not physics correctness -- a silently
wrong value or cut can still execute cleanly.
