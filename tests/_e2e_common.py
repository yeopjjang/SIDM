"""Shared helpers for the per-PR chain report (chain_report.py).

Runs the SidmProcessor over a small committed fixture (a 200-event 2Mu2E signal
file) and exposes the pieces the report compares between `main` and the PR:
  * broken hist collections    -- static: collections referencing undefined hists
  * processor warnings         -- the "Unable to apply ... Skipping" lines, captured
  * per-channel cutflow counts -- raw + weighted cumulative counts (selection regression)
  * channel health             -- which channels are regression-insensitive on the fixture

There is no committed baseline: chain_report.py recomputes both sides from the
checkout it runs against, so there is nothing for these helpers to keep in sync.
