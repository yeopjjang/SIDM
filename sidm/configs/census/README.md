# Published file censuses

Each row is a completed **shallow ("light") census** of one location YAML. The
committed `*.census.summary.json` in this directory holds the per-sample rollup, the
dropped-file list (with reasons), and the provenance `meta` (source-YAML sha256,
`complete` + `n_enumerated`/`n_probed`, backend). The **full per-file manifest** and the
**cleaned per-sample filelists** that jobs run over live on EOS under
`/store/group/lpcmetx/SIDM/census/<run-id>/` as `manifest.json` + `cleaned_filelists.tar.gz`.

**Total: 193,389 files** across 5 censuses, 586 dropped (bad / unreachable / empty -- excluded from the cleaned filelists), 81 runs-count anomalies (kept).

**runs-anomaly** = files where the Runs-tree counters (genEventCount + genEventSumw) undercount the Events tree (Events > genEventCount) -- a producer counting convention in the signal ntuples, NOT corruption. These files are KEPT (they process cleanly); normalize from the Events genWeight sum, not the Runs Sw.

Each run is `complete`: the dask driver and the Condor merge both reconcile probed-
vs-enumerated counts and refuse to publish a partial census as complete. To load any
run, `xrdcp` its `manifest.json` from the EOS path above (see the notebook).
