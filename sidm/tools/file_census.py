"""SIDM file census — Phase 1 (read-only).

For every input ROOT file of a sample -- INCLUDING the ones hand-commented-out in the
location YAMLs (which `make_fileset` never sees, because `yaml.safe_load` drops the
`# - ...root` lines) -- open the file over xrootd and read ONLY the per-file `Runs`
tree (`genEventSumw`, `genEventCount`); no event loop. Each file gets a durable verdict
(reachable / bad / unreachable / inconclusive) and, when reachable, its generator-weight
census. This settles two things at once:

  1. which of the commented files are genuinely bad vs wrongly retired, and
  2. the pre-vs-post-skim question for `Runs.genEventSumw` -- MEASURED per file by
     comparing `Runs.genEventCount` to the `Events`-tree entry count, never assumed
     (a wrong guess mis-normalizes a skimmed sample by up to ~7500x).

The verdict discipline mirrors condor/campaign_lib.py: a file is condemned only on a
positive, deterministic failure (a reproducible open/decompress error, or a server
"no such file"); a timeout or redirector hiccup is `inconclusive` and retried, never
blacklisted. Pure standard library + uproot (no coffea/awkward), so it ships clean to
a dask or Condor worker later.

Phase 1 is serial and prints a census + writes a JSON manifest. Scale-out (dask/Condor)
and the committed YAML manifest + normalization wiring are later phases.
