    Workers run as Condor jobs inside the coffea-dask apptainer image; the
    client (the notebook process) stays in the sidm_venv outside the apptainer.
    The local sidm/ tree is shipped to each worker via UploadDirectory, so
    uncommitted edits are visible to workers without a git push.

    Args:
        min_workers, max_workers: passed to cluster.adapt(). Default min=1
            keeps a worker around for immediate response. Pass min_workers=0
            for fully adaptive behavior (workers only when work is queued).
        memory, disk: per-worker resource request.
        cores: per-worker CPU cores (also dask threads).
        death_timeout: seconds a worker waits to contact the scheduler before
            self-terminating. Raised from the dask default of 60 because LPC
            condor queues can leave workers idle for several minutes.
        image: apptainer image for workers. Default matches the coffea version
            in sidm_venv (2025.5.0rc2, py3.11). For other coffea versions, look
            under /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/coffeateam/.
        sidm_local_dir: path to a local sidm/ source tree to upload to each
            worker. The local checkout (including uncommitted changes) is what
            workers see. Set to None to skip; the worker then sees only what is
            already in the apptainer image.
        condor_config: path to a CONDOR_CONFIG file. Defaults to
            condor/lpc_condor_config in this repo, a minimal LPC interactive
            config that omits the cmslpc-local-conf.py include directive
            (which references a per-user file that does not exist on every node).
        **cluster_kwargs: forwarded to LPCCondorCluster.

    Returns:
        (cluster, client) tuple. Caller is responsible for cluster.close().
