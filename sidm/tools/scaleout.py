    Workers run as Condor jobs inside the coffea-dask apptainer image; the
    client (the notebook process) stays in the sidm_venv outside the apptainer.
    The local sidm/ tree is shipped to each worker via UploadDirectory, so
    uncommitted edits are visible to workers without a git push.

    Args:
        min_workers, max_workers: passed to cluster.adapt(). Default min=1
            keeps a worker around for immediate response. Pass min_workers=0
            for fully adaptive behavior (workers only when work is queued).
        memory, disk: per-worker resource request.
        cores: per-worker CPU cores (also dask threads).
        death_timeout: seconds a worker waits to contact the scheduler before
            self-terminating. Raised from the dask default of 60 because LPC
            condor queues can leave workers idle for several minutes.
        image: apptainer image for workers. Default matches the coffea version
            in sidm_venv (2025.5.0rc2, py3.11). For other coffea versions, look
            under /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/coffeateam/.
        sidm_local_dir: path to a local sidm/ source tree to upload to each
            worker. The local checkout (including uncommitted changes) is what
            workers see. Set to None to skip; the worker then sees only what is
            already in the apptainer image.
        condor_config: path to a CONDOR_CONFIG file. Defaults to
            condor/lpc_condor_config in this repo, a minimal LPC interactive
            config that omits the cmslpc-local-conf.py include directive
            (which references a per-user file that does not exist on every node).
        dashboard_port: pin the scheduler's Bokeh dashboard to this port on
            the LPC side. None (default) uses dask's default of 8787. Pass an
            int, e.g. 8790, to move the dashboard off 8787 when another one is
            already there (coffea-casa also serves its Dask dashboard on
            8787), then forward that same port in your
            `ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port>` tunnel; or pass 0 to let dask
            pick any free port. Any requested port (8787 or a pinned one) is
            only a request: if it is already in use on the node, distributed
            warns and rebinds to a random free port, so forward whatever port
            `cluster.dashboard_link` actually prints.
        **cluster_kwargs: forwarded to LPCCondorCluster.

    Returns:
        (cluster, client) tuple. Caller is responsible for cluster.close().
