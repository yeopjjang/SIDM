    """FF schema builder

    The FF schema is built from all branches found in the supplied file, which
    is intended to be a FireFighter ntuple (https://github.com/phylsix/Firefighter).
    Analogous to the procedure in in TreeMakerSchema, array collections are
    generated in three steps:

    1. The branches of vector-like objects are grouped into a single collection
       with the corresponding coordinate variables names mapped to the standard
       variable names for coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector behaviors. For example:
       - muons will behave as LorentzVectors
       - primary vertices will behave as ThreeVectors
       - missing energy will behave as a TwoVector

    2. The branches corresponding to attributes of a subobject are merged into
       a single collection associated with that subobject. For example:
       - all pfjets_pfcands_<attribute> branches are merged into a single collection

    3. The branches corresponding to the attributes and subobjects associated with
       a given object are grouped into a single collection named <object>.
       For example:
       - all pfjet_<attribute> branches are merged into a single collection so
         pfjet attributes can be accessed like pfjet.<attribute>
       - all pfjet_<subobject> branches are merged into a single collection so
         <subobject> attributes can be accessed like pfjet.<subobject>.<attribute>


    All collections are then zipped into one `base.NanoEvents` record and returned.
